          The best approach to upload a large file to the S3 bucket
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-white">
          I recently had to upload a huge file to my S3 bucket and was exploring
          the most optimal method to do so. through multiple resources and
          experimentation I was successfully able to accomplish that task.
          Searching for resources and implementation was quite a tedious
          process. Hence, I thought Iâ€™d share the implementation method I used
          for this purpose
